# Wagon Doge
## Prologue
Someone stole doge's food and hid it away in some dark place...  
Doges are hungry, what can you do?  
Duh, get the food back, of course!  
Then do it, with this gamified version of the journey.  
Encounter fire, missiles and maybe some... water?  
### Guaranteed to give you goosebumps!
